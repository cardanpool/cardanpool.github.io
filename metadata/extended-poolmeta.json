This Staking Pool is my personal project, it was hard to configure it properly and have invested a lot of time maintaining it, that's the reason why I have affection to it :)",

I thought this project to live in the long term, I've been from the beginning of shelley, and will continue as long as I can, my plan is to reinvest any reward in this staking pool, so pledge and size of the pool will be increasing."
